<h1><marquee>THIS IS MY HOBBY</marquee></h1>
HYE!!! WELCOME TO MY HOBBY SECTION
<p>
My hobbies are:
<ol>
<li>Watching Netflix
<li>Traveling
<li>Window shopping
<p>
Absolutely everyone in this planet has a different hobby. 
Naturally, they enjoy the hobby they select because a hobby is an activity that we enjoy doing for ourselves, 
and it is also something that we choose, not someone else.
<p><br>
Hobbies, as we already know, are something good that can occupy all of our free time. 
Rarely do we hear of someone who spends their entire life without a pastime. 
Even one activity is regarded as a pastime; the number of activities doesn't matter. 
Therefore, we must use our hobbies for ourselves.
